Since your payment was made directly to the airline, bypassing our usual process, we need to follow a specific approach to correct the name on your ticket.  To resolve this, we need to issue a new ticket with the correct name, which involves the following payments:  New ticket price: XXXXX <currency> Airline fee: XXXXX <currency>  Once we receive your payment, we will promptly begin processing your new ticket. Please be assured that you will receive a refund for the original ticket to your original payment method.  I understand this may not be the most straightforward process, but we are here to guide you through it. If you have any concerns or would like further clarification, feel free to let us know. We want to ensure that everything is handled smoothly and to your satisfaction.",
